# Solana
## Programs
* Programs are Smart Contracts
* A Program is compiled Code that is stored on the Blockchain
* On the Blockchain anyone can run this Code for a Fee
* The Solana Blockchain is operated by Validators

## Accounts
* On Solana are Programs stateless
* This is different from Ethereum where Smart Contracts maintain their State
* On Solana, Users have Accounts and Programs can interact with these Accounts the Users own
* One User can own arbitrarily Accounts and Programs can interact with these Accounts
* The Program itself does not hold a User's Data instead The Program interacts with Accounts that hold the User's data
